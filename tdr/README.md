# TDR

This directory contains materials used to implement a simple TDR algorithm using the data collected from an experiment carried out at the [Dedan Kimathi University of Technology Conservancy](https://www.dkut.ac.ke)'s electric fence. The algorithm uses numerical differentiation to detect change points detection on the sampled signals to obtain the time delay between incident and reflected signals. Using this time delay, we have computed the distance to the faults simulated at different points of the fence. Each notebook solves a maximum of two faults simulated at different points on the fence to make the notebooks shorter and easy to follow.
